## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript (eventlisteners and regex)
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge helped me learn many new things. Some of them are regex, location.reload(), return false; etc.
I have still not been able to fully understand REGEXs and i will suely need more practicce in them.

### Useful resources

- [email validation REGEX](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/checking-for-valid-email-address-using-regular-expressions-in-java) - This helped get the REGEX for email validaation. I really liked this pattern because it was simple and i could under the REGEX. Surely there are other pleanty of REGEXand i need to learn more about them.
- [REGEX understanding/syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand REGEX. What each symbol signifies. For people who are new to REGEX like me this proves to be very helpful.
